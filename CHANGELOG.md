## 15 Dec 2014 
Thanks to [FedericoVaga](https://github.com/FedericoVaga)
`.togglrc` now supports API token authentication. You will need to add
`api_token` to the `auth` section, and `prefer_token` to the `options` section.

## 11 Nov 2014
Major refactoring into a more MVC OO structure.

## 30 Oct 2014
Added a feature that starting, stopping, and continuing an
entry prints out the time it started or stopped. This requires a new option in
~/.togglrc: `time_format = %I:%M%p` is the default.  See
[strftime()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior)
for more options.
